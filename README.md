## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `pl.wojciech.sw_task.SwTaskApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Gradle plugin] like so:

```shell
gradle bootRun
```

## Running the application with docker (Windows 10 Home - Docker Toolbox)

First step is to build jar of the application:

```shell
gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/sw_task.0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Then build the docker container:

```shell
docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=build/libs/*.jar -t wojciech/sw_task .
```

Finally run the fresh container:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 wojciech/sw_task
```
